# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to detect spam emails using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The dataset is processed, cleaned, and transformed before applying the model. The notebook includes detailed visualizations and performance evaluation metrics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with Pandas and Numpy
- Text vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
